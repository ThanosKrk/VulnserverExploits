# VulnserverExploits

**NOTE :** *------*

## Fuzzing

The first step is to understand what the application needs in order to crash. Since we are
talking about buffer overflows and having understood the input we need to provide to
vulnserver we can start fuzzing(use and program that automatedly inputs invalid/unexpected
input) using boofuzz.
<br/>
<br/>
For this reason I have created the fuzzer.py script which manages the following:
<ul>
<li>Create a csv log file</li>
<li>Connect to target machine</li>
<li>Create a string with a fuzzable and a non-fuzzable part</li>
<li>Create a callback function which checks if banner is loaded, hence program is still running!</li>
</ul>

After using script we have found a string that breaks the program!
